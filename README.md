# Statistics of FOOTBALL - LaLiga!

The Project aims to use a variety of Machine Learning algorithms on a comprehensive Dataset of Football Match results of LaLiga to predict team-agnostic match outcomes.

Firstly, I have performed Data Analysis on this Dataset in which after analysing and parsing a single Final Dataframe is created and saved on the Hard Drive. 
Further, I have used 3 different ML Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost Classifier from which the Optimum Result is Calculated with highest Efficiency among these respective Classifiers. 
Finally, after tuning the Parameters the Win Prediction is Calculated.

This project includes Data Analysis, Data Exploration and Preparation, Data Mining, Training and Evaluating models of Machine Learning and Tuning of the Parameters.

#### I have attached the two Jupyter Notebooks named **_PrePro_** and **_Code2_** along with the data set file named **_LaLiga_**!
